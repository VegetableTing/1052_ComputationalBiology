3.(30 pts) You are given the following DNA sequence, which is believed to contain a small protein-coding gene.
GGAGGCGTAA AATGCGTACT  GGTAATGCAA  ACTAATGG
1.If this sequence is fully transcribed (used as a codingstrand), what is the corresponding mRNA sequence?
2.Which region of the mRNA do you think can be translatedinto a protein (hint: Can you identify the start codon and stop codon from themRNA sequence?)
3.What is the protein sequence encoded by the gene?
4.If the reverse-complementary strand of the DNA sequenceis also transcribed, what will be the mRNA sequence?
5.Do you think the reverse-complementary strand can encodea protein?
